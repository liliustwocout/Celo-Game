## Project Details
Celo Arena is a play-to-earn blockchain game built on the Celo network. Players connect their MetaMask wallets, bet GAME tokens to participate in games, and earn rewards based on outcomes. The game features a leaderboard tracking top players by wins and bets, plus daily rewards for active users. It's designed for the Celo Sepolia testnet, promoting blockchain adoption through fun, rewarding gameplay.

## Vision
Celo Arena envisions a future where gaming transcends entertainment, becoming a tool for financial inclusion. By integrating blockchain, we empower players worldwide to earn real value from their skills, fostering a decentralized economy. This project can revolutionize gaming by making it accessible, transparent, and rewarding, inspiring millions to explore Web3 and create new opportunities in digital ownership and community-driven rewards.

## Development Plan
1. **Smart Contract Development:** Create GAME token contract with minting (owner-only) and Arena contract for game logic, including playGame function, event emissions for results, and approval mechanisms.
2. **Leaderboard Implementation:** Add event querying for GameResult events to build a dynamic leaderboard sorted by wins and total bets.
3. **Daily Rewards Feature:** Implement frontend-based daily claims using localStorage, simulating token rewards (5 GAME tokens per day).
4. **Frontend Development:** Build React interface with wallet connection, game controls, balance display, leaderboard UI, and reward claiming.
5. **Testing and Deployment:** Test on Celo Sepolia, ensure security, and deploy contracts and app to GitHub Pages or similar.

## Personal Story
